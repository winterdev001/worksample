# Work Sample for Education Mentor (Web Engineer Course)

## Overview
This course will contain basics of web, HTML, CSS ,JS and Ruby, Ruby algorithms and Git / Github, and Ruby on Rails.

## Introduction
These are the essential skills that every engineer attending this Web Engineering Course must be familiar with. Different extrenal materials and resaurces are used to narrow down this curribulum.

## Getting started
I highly recommend to beginners who haven't learned the basics of HTML/CSS/JS and Ruby, Ruby algorithms and Git / Github that each section should be completed in order from top to bottom because some of the skills build on each other and also helps you to understand Ruby/Ruby on rails afterwards.
