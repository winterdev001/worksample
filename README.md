# Work Sample for Education Mentor (Web Engineer Course)

## Overview
This course is more about Ruby on rails and for those who did not have skills about HTML, CSS ,JS and Ruby, Ruby algorithms and Git / Github, consider checking previous textbook.

## Introduction
These are the essential skills that every engineer attending this Web Engineering Course must be familiar with. Different external materials and resources are used to narrow down this curriculum.

## Getting started
I highly recommend to every one that each heading and its sub heading should be completed in order from top to bottom because some of the skills build on each other and also helps you to understand Ruby on rails in no time.
