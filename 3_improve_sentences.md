# About What to Fix

## Let's take charge of the following issue.

#### \[Issue in charge\] 
* I didn't understand why we use .html.erb <br/>

  `Corresponding Sentence `</br>

  > In your views (that is, under *app/views* in your Rails app) you will find **.html.erb** files. ERB stands for Embedded RuBy. This just means that Rails processes some special tags in those files and produces HTML output to send back to the user.


* Why do we name controllers in prular?<br/>

  `Corresponding Sentence` <br/>

    > In rails Controller class names are pluralized. The reason is the controller controls multiple instances of object instance.
    For Example: PostsController would be the controller for a posts table.
